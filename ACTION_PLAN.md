# ACTION PLAN — Kerani_Core_SuperBasic

**Purpose:** Execute the short evidence-harvesting window without turning execution tasks into architecture decisions.  
**Authority:** Execution/progress only. `ZASS_Kerani_Core_SuperBasic.md` remains authoritative for questions, risks, decisions, experiments and readiness.  
**Planning date:** 2026-09-29  
**Source:** ZASS_Kerani_Core_SuperBasic.md v0.3.6 — same Git commit  
**ZERO → ARCHITECTURE snapshot:** 63% — DECIDING  
**Evidence Confidence snapshot:** LOW

# 1. CURRENT FOCUS

**Focus:** Freeze OpsMate as a reference implementation, harvest maximum reusable/Core and Agro evidence from it, prepare only a minimal SuperBasic skeleton, then PARK substantive implementation.

**Why:** The near-term window is too constrained for reliable Core architecture/build work. Evidence captured from a stable OpsMate baseline and pilot use is more valuable than rushing a speculative framework.

**Substantive Core implementation:** `PARKED` after the 15 October review until the owner explicitly restarts it with suitable local agentic-coding resources.

---

# 2. EXECUTION RULES

- Do not redesign OpsMate during extraction work.
- Respect the LOCKED product boundary: Core = Purchase / Sale / Inventory / Observation / Task + receipt capture; planned modules = Agro / Servis Teknikal / Makanan & Tempahan only.
- Keep full natural-language conversation in Kerani AI Premium; do not make it a SuperBasic dependency.
- Reject module work that creates special-case branching or Apps Script spaghetti.
- Do not treat source-file layout as architecture.
- Do not invent Core abstractions merely to create a skeleton.
- Do not change LOCKED ZASS decisions.
- Pilot findings are evidence: classify them as bug, observed gap or new requirement.
- Ordinary pilot findings do not automatically reopen the frozen reference baseline.
- Critical safety, data-integrity or reference-invalidating defects may trigger a deliberate freeze review.
- AI/Copilot should trace, document, classify, scaffold and test; architecture decisions return to the owner/ZASS.
- No coding agent receives unrestricted production credentials or production-message access.

# 3. 10–15 OCTOBER 2026 PLAN

| Date | Action | State | AI / Copilot role | Human role | Output / Done signal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **10 Oct** | Freeze OpsMate reference baseline | NEXT | Read repo state; collect commit SHA, relevant tests, known limitations and selected stable workflows. Draft reference metadata. | Confirm the freeze point and selected workflow scope. | Exact frozen commit + stable workflow list + limitations recorded. |
| **10 Oct** | Capture pilot findings | NEXT | Structure rough notes without inventing facts. Separate bug / observed gap / new requirement. | Supply actual pilot observations. | Pilot findings ledger exists; unresolved items are visible. |
| **11 Oct** | Build 3–5 Behaviour Maps | OPEN | Trace actual runtime end-to-end from frozen repo: entry point, route, queue, AI, guard, validation, approval, persistence and response. | Verify maps match observed behaviour. | 3–5 evidence-backed maps covering different workflow families. |
| **12 Oct** | Build reuse matrix | OPEN | Classify small behaviours as GENERIC / AGRO-GENERIC / OPSMATE-BSE-SPECIFIC / UNCERTAIN with code/test evidence. | Challenge classifications that appear too generic. | Evidence-backed reuse matrix; no whole-file classification shortcuts. |
| **13 Oct** | Extract candidate contracts | OPEN | Compare maps, identify repeated behaviour contracts and unresolved boundaries. | Accept/reject interpretations; do not LOCK architecture merely from repetition. | Candidate Request / Route / Candidate / Validation / Decision / Result / Event contracts documented. |
| **14 Oct** | Prepare minimal repository skeleton | OPEN | Create only evidence-justified folders/files, agent instructions and fixtures. Avoid framework code. | Review diff and reject speculative abstractions. | Minimal skeleton exists without fake maturity or domain leakage. |
| **15 Oct** | Review, package evidence and PARK build | OPEN | Produce gap report: what is proven, uncertain, missing and ready for future local-agent tasks. Optionally add one tiny contract fixture/test only if evidence is sufficient and time remains. | Decide what remains parked and what will be first task when build restarts. | Evidence package coherent; Core build marked PARKED; next restart task identified. |

# 4. PILOT FINDINGS FORMAT

Pilot notes may be rough. AI should normalise them into:

~~~text
ID:
Date:
Workflow:
What the user did:
What the system did:
Expected:
Classification: BUG / OBSERVED_GAP / NEW_REQUIREMENT
Severity:
Workaround:
Status:
Evidence/reference:
~~~

Do not convert a pilot request directly into Core architecture. Feed mature findings back through ZASS.

---

# 5. TARGET EVIDENCE PACKAGE BY 15 OCTOBER

Minimum useful outcome:

- frozen OpsMate commit SHA and reference scope;
- pilot findings ledger;
- 3–5 Behaviour Maps from materially different workflows;
- evidence-backed four-way reuse matrix;
- candidate behavioural contracts;
- explicit unresolved questions/risks;
- minimal repository skeleton and AI-agent instructions if time permits;
- optional small contract fixture/test only if it follows evidence already collected;
- one clear restart task for future local agentic coding.

**Not required by 15 October:**
- completed Kerani_Core_SuperBasic;
- confirmed architecture;
- production Telegram adapter;
- multi-provider framework;
- generic database abstraction;
- plugin system;
- Kerani Agro implementation;
- full non-farm proof application;
- additional domain modules beyond Agro, Servis Teknikal and Makanan & Tempahan;
- Kerani AI Premium natural-language conversation.

# 6. AI WORK MODE

For each task, AI/Copilot should:

1. read the frozen reference and relevant ZASS records;
2. inspect actual implementation/test evidence;
3. make the smallest evidence-backed artifact/change;
4. mark uncertainty explicitly;
5. run available tests/checks when code changes;
6. show changed files/diff and PASS/FAIL;
7. stop when an architecture decision is required.

Preferred task size: one workflow, one evidence table, one contract, one fixture or one small scaffold at a time.

---

# 7. STOP / PARK RULE

On **15 October 2026**, stop substantive Core work after the evidence review unless the owner explicitly extends the window.

After that:

`Kerani_Core_SuperBasic substantive build = PARKED`

Restart trigger:

`Owner explicitly restarts build with suitable local agentic-coding resources.`

The first restart session should consume the frozen evidence package rather than re-reading OpsMate from zero.
